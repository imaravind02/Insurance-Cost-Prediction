# Insurance Cost Prediction Project

## Project Title
**Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning**

---

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs based on customer demographic and health-related factors using Machine Learning models. The objective is to analyze how different attributes such as age, BMI, smoking habits, number of children, and region influence insurance charges and to build a predictive model for accurate cost estimation.

This project is implemented using Python and common data science libraries in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
